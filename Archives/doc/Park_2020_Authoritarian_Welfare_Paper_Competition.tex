\noindent This paper evaluates why authoritarian regimes design social policies to provide the welfare. Social welfare policies are coordinated outcomes that link the political and economic realms together. Despite a rich literature on this topic in industrialized democracies, little research has investigated the mechanisms in authoritarian regimes. I argue that the limited focus on welfare provision in democracies stems from several flawed assumptions about the ability of modern autocracies to create similar programs and the mechanisms behind it. Although autocrats are more autonomous decision makers than democratic leaders, they rarely rule alone. As such, social policies in authoritarian regimes are driven by the autocrats’ need to create stable ruling coalitions. The welfare provided in authoritarian regimes should differ depending on the groups on which the autocrat depends for support. The ability to effectively decommodify welfare and provide assistance should also vary based on regime characteristics and resource availability. I examine this using data on authoritarian regimes and social policies over the period 1917 to 2000, showing that authoritarian welfare provision depends on the ruling coalition in place.

\noindent \lettrine{H}ow successfully can we explain the variations of welfare provision among countries with the existing theories? Scholars have investigated the causes and consequences of welfare state variation for several decades, and it has become one of the major themes in comparative politics. Questions of the welfare state, however, have covered the variations of welfare within advanced industrial democracies \citep{Pierson1996, Pierson2000, Miller2015c}. Despite a rich literature on this topic in industrialized democracies, little research has investigated the mechanisms in authoritarian regimes. Do authoritarian regimes provide welfare to their citizens? Research on the welfare of democracies expects that democracies would provide greater stability and more effective public policies for citizens to foster their quality of life \citep{Gerring2012}. Authoritarian regimes also design social policies and provide a set of welfare programs, but it is not clear for whom the policies and programs are targeting, unlike democracies. Then, what would be a key mechanism to explain the variation of welfare in the non-democratic world?\footnote{The paper uses the terms referring to non-democracies, such as authoritarian regime, dictatorship, and autocracy interchangeably.}\par

This paper evaluates why authoritarian regimes design social policies to promote the welfare of citizens. Social welfare policies are coordinated outcomes that link the political and economic realms together. Many theoretical studies have proposed that democracy is somehow related to higher levels of welfare provisions \citep{Muller1988, Sirowy1990, Korpi1998} with several key concepts; the logic of industrialism \citep{Heclo1974, Wilensky1975, PrzeworskiandLimongi1993}, inherent characteristics of democratic institutions \citep{Muller1988, Pierson1996, Gerring2012}, compensating for the specific social groups \citep{Cameron1978, Rodrik1998, Burgoon2001a, Adsera2002} and distribution of political resources across classes within a society \citep{Gosta1989, Gosta1990, Korpi1998}. The central mechanism of conventional wisdom explains variations of welfare provision with social pressures for extensive welfare under democracies since democratic governments are more subject to demands from citizens in theory. However, very few studies have attempted to explain the variation of welfare with the mechanisms in existing theories for authoritarian welfare states.\par

I argue that the limited focus on welfare provision in democracies stems from several flawed assumptions about the ability of modern autocracies to create similar programs and the mechanisms behind it. Although autocrats are more autonomous decision-makers than democratic leaders, they rarely rule alone \citep{Gandhi2006, Frantz2014a}. As such, social policies in authoritarian regimes are driven by the autocrats’ need to create stable ruling coalitions. The welfare provided in authoritarian regimes should differ depending on the groups on which the autocrat depends for support. The ability to effectively decommodify welfare and provide assistance should also vary based on regime characteristics and resource availability. I examine this using data on authoritarian regimes and welfare programs, showing that authoritarian welfare provision depends on the ruling coalition in place.\par

I organize the remainder of the paper as follows. In the next two sections, I review the theoretical backgrounds of the welfare states. From the previous explanations of the welfare state, I develop the theoretical framework of our analysis. The following sections describe the dataset and empirical models I have constructed to test the hypotheses generated by this framework. The subsequent sections present and discuss our empirical results, and we conclude by addressing issues for further inquiry.

\section{Literature Reviews} 
\subsection{Understanding Welfare Regimes} 
Studies of welfare state have mostly been conducted in democratic countries with comparable and available data \citep{Jessop1984, Gosta1989, Gosta1990, Rudra2005, Huber2008, Hudson2009}. From the 19th century, as Western democracies expanded the universal franchise, the levels and coverage of social policies had expanded. Previous studies have provided empirical evidence that democracy has seen broader and deeper levels of welfare or social spending \citep{Lindert2005,Stasavage2005,HaggardKaufman2008}. They have made great efforts to find the regularity of social policies in democracies, and the strands of inquiry are so-called ``Welfare state'' studies.\par

The phrase welfare state was first used to describe Labour Britain after 1945, and the first usage of the phrase rarely defined what it is but just described it with democratic sentiments such as social rights \citep[9-10]{Briggs1961}. The label ‘welfare state’ incorporates not only Britain but also all modern industrialized countries, defining “a state in which organized power is deliberately used to modify the play of market forces in at least three directions---first, by guaranteeing individuals and families a minimum income irrespective of the market value of their work or their property; second, but narrowing the extent of insecurity by enabling individuals and families to meet certain ‘social contingencies’ (for example, sickness, old age, and unemployment) which lead otherwise to individual and family crises; and third, by ensuring that all citizens without distinction of status or class are offered the best standards available in relation to a certain agreed range of social services” \citep[14]{Briggs1961}. Based on the definition, several studies have investigated what makes differences in social expenditure across countries \citep{Cameron1978, Rodrik1998, Adsera2002}.\par

However, \citet{Gosta1990} argues that we should not focus on particular social policy \textit{per se}, but on how different countries arrive at their peculiar public-private sector mix \citep[2]{Gosta1990}. According to \citet{Gosta1990}, tracing the development of a welfare state with the size of social expenditure (or public spending) may be ahistorical and overlook the process. \citet{Gosta1990} focused on the two significant dimensions of welfare, decommodification, and stratification. On the one hand, decommodification is an indicator as to where the status of individuals in the market is. A state can intervene to secure the lost in the market through compensating for potential loss of job, income. Also, a state can provide general welfare for protecting citizens from sickness, injuries, unemployment. On the other hand, stratification is the status of individuals based on their class positions \citep{Gosta1990}.\par

The fundamental mechanism of the research is based on a class coalition. With qualitative research, \citet{Gosta1990} suggests that the structure of class coalitions is vital, pressing the ruling government toward specific types of welfare states. Thus, it is essential which classes go to make a coalition and whether the coalition successfully takes the ruling initiative of the state. It implies that the attempt of \citet{Gosta1990} to develop a typology of welfare states is based on power distribution in a society. He is, therefore, centrally concerned with how to explain the power structures underlying different welfare states \citep[88]{Kemeny1995}. In other words, the three types of the welfare state in \citet{Gosta1990}---Liberal, Conservative, and Social democracy represent macro-features of how a country forms the class coalition to design and provides welfare \citep[646]{Scruggs2008}.

Subsequent studies of \citet{Gosta1990} continued to categorize the welfare state based on different characteristics \citep[14]{Arcanjo2006}; coverage, citizenship right \citep{Ferrera1996}, relative size of social expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic products \citep{Bonoli1997}, or needs and contributions \citep{Korpi1998}. The main argument of \citet{Gosta1990} and following studies is that differential structuring of power relationships between classes is a political and policy-making process, making it possible to distinguish between different types of the welfare state. In other words, the thesis of \citet{Gosta1990} is much more than a descriptive typology but is ultimately founded on power relationships between social classes \citep[89]{Kemeny1995}.\par

\subsection{Welfare Regimes in Autocracies}

\citet{Pierson2000} and \citet{Scruggs2008a} criticize that the \textit{three worlds of welfare state} are only tested in limited democracies and not eligible to explain the variations of welfare states, which are on the boundary between the types. It is partially right. We cannot solve the puzzle of welfare state concerning authoritarian regimes with the existing theories on the welfare state since the previous arguments assume particular values of democratic institutions. When a state is an authoritarian regime, it does not guarantee compensation its citizens for the losses from the market. In authoritarian regimes, the power of the state is more likely personalized, and the rules are more likely to be established simply and efficiently using fiat and forces \citep[4]{Gerring2012}. However, I argue that the mechanism of \citet{Gosta1990}'s three worlds can be the key to solve the puzzles in authoritarian regimes with `class coalition.' \par

On one hand, the power resource theory suggesting that democracies are more likely to provide universal welfare because they rely on broader coalitions is nothing more than the selectorate theory \citep{BDM1999, BuenodeMesquita2003}. The selectorate theory states that leaders, facing challengers who wish to depose them, maintain their coalitions of supporters by taxing and spending in ways that allocate mixtures of public and private goods. The theory assumes each member of the selectorate (\textit{S}) who is responsible for making a leader has an equal probability of being in a  winning coalition. According to this logic, as the size of the winning coalition (\textit{W}) becomes smaller or the size of the selectorate becomes larger, challenges are less likely to need or use the support of any particular individual when forming their winning coalition. It is riskier to defect when the size of \textit{W} shrinks or the size of \textit{S} grows.\par 

On the other hand, studies on authoritarian regimes argue that we should consider the \textit{varieties of authoritarian regimes}, which means not every authoritarian regime is the same \citep{Geddes1999, Geddes2014, Cheibub2010, Wahman2013, Roller2013, Soest2015}. In reality, we can observe authoritarian regimes have distinctive leadership groups such as dominant party, military, monarchy, or personalized factions \citep{Geddes2014}. Generally, studies have a consensus that the party based regime has a larger coalition compared to the personalist regime, which has a small coalition to remain in office \citep{Levitsky2002, Levitsky2010a, Gandhi2009}. It is the point where the two lines of inquiry of selectorate theory and varieties of authoritarian regimes meet to explain the authoritarian welfare state.\par

The welfare state literature provides some case studies that authoritarian regimes provide welfare programs \citep{Tang2000, Kwon2005a, Orenstein2008, Bader2015, Ong2015, Morgenbesser2017}. Regardless of the regime types, political leaders seek to stay in office. The more typical a dictator, the more inherently unstable his power is. Although the leaders of democracy are regularly exposed to pressure from below through various institutions, the autocrats are under fewer constraints. It makes autocrats more powerful than democratic leaders, but also makes the feedback on policy impossible, resulting in a dilemma that fundamentally weakens his leadership. In other words, the autonomy of the dictator entails cost \citep[335]{Wintrobe1998}. It means that autocrats have incentives to provide public goods to reduce the risks from the dilemma. 

Here, there are two differences between democracies and authoritarian regimes for welfare provisions. First, the leaders under authoritarian regimes are less constrained to make decisions than the leaders under democracies because the political power of authoritarian regimes is more likely to be personlized or centralized on particular individual or groups. Second, unlike democracies, authoritarian regimes only need to be concerned with the citizens who are essential for staying in office. In other words, authoritarian regimes do not have incentives to care ``all citizens.'' Thus, in terms of providing a public good to stay in office, we would expect some authoritarian regimes to be subject to smaller dynamics discussed in the literature of democratization on the welfare regime and democracies. Also, some forms of authoritarian regimes are expected to be more likely to provide welfare. In other words, autocrats are more autonomous decision-makers than democratic leaders; however, they do not rule alone. The needs of autocrats to secure their ruling coalition which is a coordinated social group to secure the political survival of autocrats and their stable ruling drive the social policies to promote welfare even in authoritarian regimes \citep{Svolik2012}. Thus, with smaller coalitions, authoritarian regimes provide welfare because it is closely related to the credible commitment for co-optation.

Explanations of welfare provision in democracies have something in common. They argue that the social groups belonging to selectorate transform their needs into a sort of pressure to push towards particular sets of social policies. For example, a simple but essential analytical model, relating democratic institutions and welfare, comes from \citet{Meltzer1981}, who focus on the effects of electoral competition.\footnote{\citet{Boix2003} provide overviews of this issue} This model assumes that the median voter is the critical voter to determine the size of government, which is measured by the share of income redistributed. It implies that the size of the government depends on the relationship between mean income and median income. Here, the size of selectorate that depends on the regime types is important. Whereas democracy provides a universal franchise, which leads the median voter to have a below-average income in an unequal society, one of the poor who favors higher taxes and more welfare. In authoritarian regimes, the median voter who can affect the policy-making process would belong to a much smaller selectorate. It means that the median voter in an authoritarian regime is more likely to be one of the rich or the upper-class \citep[2]{Yi2014}.\par

The studies on \textit{varieties of authoritarian regimes} have focused on which social groups matter and affect the decision of autocrats. From the \citet{Geddes1999} and \citet{Geddes2014}, scholars have attempted to uncover the decisive leadership group, which controls the policy-making process within the regime. However, when we connect the previous discussion of authoritarian welfare to class coalition---ruling coalition of autocracies, it becomes clear that we need to concern ourselves with how much autocrats consider the selectorate and how large the coalition size is because it shows the extent of welfare the autocrats should provide. It means that the welfare provided in authoritarian regimes should differ depending on the groups on which the autocrat depends for support.\par

However, existing approaches of discrete authoritarian regime types are not free from the validity issues \citep{Wilson2014}. \citet[52]{Roller2013} shows whether and how the choice of data sets impacts the empirical results on the determinants and consequences of authoritarian regimes. Also, most of the studies to examine performances of authoritarian regimes utilizes the method of residues of which we make all unidentified regime types as one type. It makes it challenging to state which authoritarian type is different from what.

\subsection{The Primacy of Coalitions}

Autocrats have two fundamental problems, which cannot be solved by a single strategy. One is the problem of power-sharing, which is about challenges from the elites. The other is the problem of control in which autocrats face threats from the masses they rule \citep{Svolik2012}. The processes to resolve the problems in authoritarian regimes are not transparent and formal, contrary to in democracies. When an autocrat faces these two fundamental problems, she may have two strategies of coercion and co-optation. The autocratic welfare is closely related to the latter strategy. For instance, authoritarian regimes establish institutions to encourage regime stability for autocrat through signaling secured property rights and credible commitment \citep{Gandhi2007, Wright2008}.

In authoritarian regimes, we can expect the welfare might be the same as the means to co-opt the classes from selectorate of which the members are potential constituents for the ruling coalition. Given that authoritarian social policies are to effectively stabilize and sustain the system through co-opting the supports of selectorate, social policies should be more credible and reliable than private goods, which the autocrat can distribute at his discretion. \citet{Knutsen2018} emphasizes that pensions are a good example of institutionalized club goods for autocrats to use with particular target groups. They specify old-age pensions as a useful tool for autocrats to reduce the threats of revolt and to co-opt their opponents. They argue that especially old-age pensions affect a wide range of beneficiaries as the pensions do not depend on an unexpected event such as unemployment, sickness. The old-age pensions may be relatively universal to other types of welfare. In the authoritarian regime, as mentioned above, autocrats only have the incentive to provide old-age pension programs to secure targeted supporter groups \citep[670]{Knutsen2018}. In conclusion, \citet[688]{Knutsen2018} argue that ``major pension programs are not restricted to democracies $\cdots$ Autocrats use pensions to direct resources to critical supporting groups.''

How universal welfare programs are offered, and which ones to focus more on, depends on which class the regime should co-opt. This study understands that class exerts social pressure on decision-makers through different and distinctive interests or means of political mobilization. Therefore, it is necessary to examine which classes are politically significant and identifiable \citep{Bean1998}. In this paper, I take the assumption of \citet[1495]{Dahlum2019}: individuals who belong to similar socioeconomic strata are more likely to have converging preferences over social policies.

%In Western Europe, agriculture was the dominant production structure of society until the industrial revolution between the late 18th and early 19th centuries emerged. The source of the political resources of the elite was based on agriculture. Although the landowners of the peasants and bourgeois expanded over time, the feudal manor lords occupied the land ownership steadily. The feudal lords---the agrarian elite has accumulated surplus labor or surplus products from the peasants or tenant farmers in the form of rents by lending common lands. \citet{Ansell2015a} suggest that the ruling elite in the early stage can be divided into two groups. They call the two groups as the relative economic elites and the autocratic elite \footnote{This study defines the relative economic elites as groups of people who have industrial goods (economic power) without political power.}. Also, \citet{Ansell2015a} considers the autocratic elite as the incumbent elite who gains his resources from its local agricultural section.

A line of inquiry argues economic and class-based explanations to account for democratic transition, development \citep[4-5]{ziblatt2017conservative}, and welfare state \citep{Huber1993,HuberStephens2001,Korpi2006}. The explanations usually classify classes that are important in a regime into two types, \textit{middle class} and \textit{working class}. On the one hand, the middle class is the group that has the economic capability. The middle class contributes to economic balance and, at the same time, serves as a buffer against political extremes. Socially, it also serves as a role model for low-income groups, while playing a role of social balance by having a specific collective identity that is distinct from the upper classes. For example, Some evaluate the middle class as the driving force for democratization historically \citep{Moore1993Social}. In line with literature on democratization, we can expect that the middle class can be seen as an effective source of threatening the regime. It also makes the middle class important when I explore the influence of classes on welfare programs in authoritarian regimes.

The middle class can be identified as a politically significant social group to co-opt since whether to make a coalition with the middle class determine the costs of repression. Also, theories that find the cause of economic development in the distribution of political power also suggested that the middle-class influences market growth by contributing to the development of democracy and preventing dictatorship \citep{Easterly2001}. Many studies suggest that middle-class supplies crucial support for the popular mobilizations \citep{Rosenfeld2017, Dahlum2019}. Regarding incentives to co-opt, however, the middle class can be seen as a heterogeneous group. Remaining in office, authoritarian leaders should make a coalition with the group that might have motivation and capability for regime transition \citep{Dahlum2019}. Thus, I expect that the middle class, in particular, the urban middle class, would have higher leverage for authoritarian leaders.

On the other hand, the working class can be an important factor in the development of redistributive social policy, partly through its effects on the partisan composition of government (\citealp{HuberStephens2001}, \citealp[794]{Rasmussen2018}). According to \citet[175]{Korpi2006}, the working class is a collectively mobilized group of employees who are dependent on the labor force. Mobilization of the working class is closely related to the development of the welfare state \citep{Shalev1983}. The expectation that the working class will have a converging preference is based on the assumption that the group of workers has the same interest in ensuring security from the risk of the market. \citet[1495]{Dahlum2019} argues that the urban working class (e.g., industrial workers) and the rural working class (peasants) show different levels of capabilities to organize nationwide or localize strikes for the regime transitions. However, in terms of co-optation, the two different working classes can have another different narratives of motivation; do they pursue same welfare programs? Although the urban working class is in the capitalist mode of production and has motivation to change their labor environment fundamentally, the rural working class is understood as the group in the feudal mode of production. Thus, when the treats of turmoil are deduced by the leverages and motivations of social groups, the urban working class would be the social class autocrats should co-opt.

%Since the rural working class can be influenced by urbanization or industrialization, the rural working class, and the urban class are not exclusive to each other. \citet[1932]{Chandra2002} shows an example of the Russian revolution. The rural working class is understood as the transitional group between the remnants of feudal and the capitalist mode of production. The rural working class and the urban working class were co-opted because they were in a continuous line by looking at the production of rural working classes as the basis of capitalist development.

The rural working class and the urban working class were co-opted because they were in a continuous line by looking at the production of rural working classes as the basis of capitalist development. 

Besides the income based classes, groups based on specific institutions also matter with regards to the political survival of autocrats. \citet{Geddes1999} and \citet{Geddes2014} proposes different types of leadership groups are able to make the most important decisions in the authoritarian regime. This group makes key policies, and autocrats must retain the support of its members to remain in power, even though autocrats may also have substantial ability to influence the group's membership. Institution-based class refers to additional coalition members, and it provides valuable alternative bluntly constructed regime types. Specific institutions create a class of elites with distinct interests and incentives. For instance, parties are not the only way to mobilize the masses, but if created, it may offer goods to its leadership, party elites. 

The military and party elites are the institution-based groups, which show close ties with authoritarian leaders. First, the military does not depend on military leaders’ personal characteristics. Instead, the military is characterized by collegial forms meaning ``rule by the military as institution'' \citep{Geddes2014b, Kim2017}. I expect the military as the collegial group would have converging interests and capabilities over social policies. Secondly, when an authoritarian regime has party institutions, the party institution can serve interactive functions rather than one-way. It implies that party institution is not only the platform to mobilize the support from the masses \citep{Gandhi2006}, but also the mechanisms making the party elite seek particular interests. Through the party institution, the party elite can shape his interests, which are different from the interests of other classes.

% When an authoritarian regime successfully co-opts the class that matters to its political survival, it does not need to be on track of democratization. 
\section{Theory}
\subsection{A Coalitional Theory of Welfare Provision in Autocracies}

According to the studies on democratization, threats of overthrown from social mobilization makes the autocratic predecessors introduce democratic institutions to expand suffrage or to guarantee various rights for political and economic participation \citep{Acemoglu2005,Acemoglu2006a}. When a regime becomes democracy, all citizens have rights to vote, and freedom of association. Democratic institutions can make citizens require more resource distribution than in authoritarian regime \citep{Meltzer1981}, and allow citizens to aggregate class interests toward extensive welfare and form labor unions \citep{Korpi2006}. The interaction of organized power resources (union) and leftist parties will lead to higher levels of social policies in terms of universalism. 

However, the theory does not hold in an authoritarian regime because autocrat does not guarantee the mechanism, which citizens can transform their political resources into social pressures. In an authoritarian regime, citizens rarely have the right to vote and have freedom of association. When the power resource theory explains the welfare provisions with the demand side, supply-side explanations are required to explain why autocrat provides welfare programs to his citizens. In other words, I emphasize the response of elites as decisive for illustrating authoritarian welfare states.

A coalition theory I develop in this paper argues that different classes that autocrats need to co-opt have different influence on welfare provisions in authoritarian regimes. The observable features of authoritarian welfare provisions look similar with what I find in previous literature. As the social mobilization poses possible or potential threat of overthrow, autocrats are more likely to appease the threat and co-opt the oppositions with credible commitment, which means it should be hard to withdraw and be consistently provided. Welfare programs can represent this commitment that autocrats could provide citizens in exchange for targeted support or at least passive obedience \citep{Cassani2017a}.

Then, who does posit the possible threats on autocrats? I focus on the working class that has strong preference toward extensive welfare. Many pieces of literature on democratization emphasizes the threats of middle class. However, the middle class does not only tend to resist the extension of the suffrage or support jingoistic foreign policies historically \citep{Lipset1959}, but also cooperate with existing elites as becoming state officials, regional civil servants through state careers \citep{Rosenfeld2017}. On the contrary, the working class is more sensitive to the change in the distribution of wealth and provisions of welfare than the middle class since it has the members as employees who depend primarily on the labor force \citep{Korpi2006}.

After the period of the Russian Revolution, I expect autocrats should consider the working class as a necessary component of their ruling coalition to stay in power even rather than the middle class that is usually considered as an essential group for welfare extension and regime transition. The Russian Revolution was the first case that showed the possibility of the working class to be an effective group to overthrow existing elites. Thus, it is not difficult to anticipate that autocrats would consider co-opting the working class, especially when the working class is the important social group in the regime. After the Russian Revolution, the power of the working class might increase, and the more efforts of autocrats to buy their support should be required. Thus, I propose the first hypothesis:\par

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:first}] \label{hyp:first}
	The working class's influence on universal welfare is greater than the middle class.
\end{hyp}
%\noindent HYPOTHESIS 1: If all other conditions are the same, the working class's influence on universal welfare is greater than the middle class over time.\\ \par

%The second hypothesis attempts to reveal how the delivery of welfare varies depending on the class coalition. From \citet{Briggs1961} to \citet{Gosta1990},  subsequent studies on welfare state have focused on the functions of decommodification and stratification. The constructs of decommodification were set as old-age pensions, sickness, and unemployment programs. Studies of welfare considered these programs as social policies, which provide direct cash benefits and subsidies \citep{VanVoorhis2002}. However, the welfare state is not only about cash benefits, but also about the actual delivery of services to foster recipients' welfare. When authoritarian politics is rarely a zero-sum game \citep{Olson1993a}, delivering public services could be a more efficient strategy for political survival than the selective distribution of private goods. It is more likely to be when autocrats should buy the supports of relatively large constituencies (\citealp{BuenodeMesquita2003}, \citealp[352]{Cassani2017a}).\par

%\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:second}] \label{hyp:second}
%	If all other conditions are the same, the working class's influence on cash-benefit welfare programs (e.g., old-age pensions, sickness, and unemployment) decreases compared to other classes.
%\end{hyp}
%\noindent HYPOTHESIS 2: If all other conditions are the same, the working class's influence on cash-benefit welfare programs (e.g., old-age pensions, sickness, and unemployment) decreases over time compared to other classes.\\ \par

%The way to deliver welfare to citizens can explain the differences within or between the arrangements of welfare states \citep{Castles2009}. From the Russian Revolution, the numeric power and the power resources of the working class have increased. It implies that I can expect the effect of the working class on types of welfare delivery would vary over time. As the working class increases and becomes dominant, autocrats are more likely to provide benefits through a non-cash benefit welfare program, which can be considered as `public goods' \citep{Bambra2005}. In other words, authoritarian regimes that should care larger selectorate for the potential class coalition would prefer non-cash benefits welfare programs since it is costly to afford.

%In other words, the party-based authoritarian regime will face a larger selectorate to co-opt than other types of authoritarian regimes. 

%In particular, I expect the working class would be pressure to expand welfare provisions.

%The two general hypotheses aim to show how the mechanisms of class coalition and welfare provision work in an authoritarian context. If party-based regime (institutionalized parties) provide more welfare since it targets a broader class coalition of the society, other types of the authoritarian regime would show the different variation of the welfare targeting their specific class coalition. It is expected that the incentives of welfare provision might make targetable sources of welfare more valuable. The two hypotheses can also test the alternative hypothesis of co-optation in the authoritarian regime. Autocrats usually suffer from the uncertainty of longevity and succession \citep{Brownlee2007b}. Where longevity means the time horizon of incumbent autocrats, the succession problem is about the post-tenure issue of autocrats. Also, personalist authoritarian regimes are more likely to rely on personalized factions to rule and maintain power. It means that they have less institutionalized measures for co-optation for their selectorate, potential rivals, or revolts. However, personalist autocrats also need specific rents for their coalition. The autocrats would prefer other measures for private goods as it is costly for them. Thus, autocrats with the less institutionalized world may utilize the path like old-pension programs to deliver the resources to their core supporters. Providing pension and other social policy programs that cover the core groups for coalition can be an effective strategy for the autocrats' political survival \citep{Knutsen2018}. It is an alternative hypothesis, which is against the theoretical backgrounds of class coalition mechanism that the level of welfare provision increases as the size of coalition increases.\par

%In sum, I expect that party institutionalization matters as it can show how the class coalition in authoritarian regimes works. However, the argument of this paper is distinguishable from \citet{Rasmussen2019}. Although parties are the common factor, which some authoritarian regimes and democracies both have institutionalized parties, \textit{per se} cannot explain the whole world of welfare across authoritarian regimes and democracies. Like the particular indicator of the \textit{three worlds of welfare state}, party institutionalization also indicates particular and empirical aspects of the mechanism of the class coalition. Also, the class coalition mechanism can extend to not only how universal the welfare programs of the regime are, but also which programs the regime is mainly concerned with.

Recent works propose a potential alternative explanation for authoritarian welfare programs. Focusing the capacity of parties to provide public goods, \citet{Bizzarro2018} argue that highly institutionalized parties can contribute to fostering economic performances. According to \citet{Bizzarro2018}, parties are not only the platforms that make leaders and members be tied strongly, and also the mechanisms to have a relatively long time horizon through solving coordination problems. This piece of research implies that institutionalized parties can absorb the influence of classes on welfare programs. Furthermore, \citet{Rasmussen2019} explains the variations of welfare universalism by focusing on party institutionalization, which means (1) how decisions in parties are based on clear, stable rules and (2) how the decisions are informed through the networks linking party elites with other broad constituencies of the party. The main argument of the article is on the same line with the class coalition and co-optation. As "institutionalized parties allow politicians to overcome coordination problems, avoid capture by special interests and form stable linkages with broad social groups, institutionalized parties enable and make political elites to pursue extensive welfare policies" even under an authoritarian regime. In other words, the more autocrats with institutionalized parties want to maintain power, the more likely they are to run universal social policies. On the contrary, if the authoritarian regime personalizes the power for the few (without or with less institutionalized parties), the more selective programs targeting the particular groups of supporters will be. 

For example, \citet{Orenstein2008} states that Communist governments provided much more social benefits such as full employment to their citizens than did other types of authoritarian regimes. Also, \citet{Morgenbesser2017} shows that the ruling party of Singapore utilizes a diverse range of co-optation measures designed to elicit greater compliance amongst citizens, opposition members, and political elites. The strategy of co-optation includes social policies that subsidize education and primary medical care, but also comprehensive public housing. Nevertheless, an authoritarian regime does not fully rely on political parties. It shows that the existence of institutionalized parties can affect the social policies of welfare. Since Major General Park Chung-hee led a coup and captured power in 1961, the South Korean government was occupied by the previous or current members of the military. Although South Korea calls this era as the period under the military regime, effective but constrained, political parties and legislature worked. Even though the level of constraints was much less than other advanced democracies, the South Korean government should consider the parties and legislature to enact laws. The military regime used some appeasement measures to control the workers and to win popular support. It shows the military regime’s embodiment of welfare state ideals \citep[90-93]{Tang2000}. For the same reason that the institutionalized party can help autocrats to distribute resources to their citizens, I establish the subsequent hypothesis:\par

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:second}] \label{hyp:second}
	The higher levels of party institutionalization increase the universality of welfare programs.
\end{hyp}
%\noindent HYPOTHESIS 3: If all other conditions are the same, the higher levels of party institutionalization increases the universality of welfare programs.\\ \par
%\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:fourth}] \label{hyp:fourth}
%	If all other conditions are the same, the working class's influence on universal welfare is greater than the middle class when party institutionalization increases.
%\end{hyp}
%\noindent HYPOTHESIS 4: If all other conditions are the same, the working class's influence on universal welfare is greater than the middle class over time when party institutionalization increases.\\ \par

Both hypothesis \ref{hyp:first} and hypothesis \ref{hyp:second} argue that coalition with working pushes autocrats to promote universal welfare programs, and institutionalized party enhances universal welfare programs. When we expect that institutionalized parties contribute to universal welfare programs by forming stable linkages with broad social groups, then the institutionalized party can aggregate the demands of working classes in a more organized and efficient way. It means that when the demand-side (working classes) requires universal welfare and there exists a platform (institutionalized party) to redeem their desire credibly, then autocrats can handle the class coalition using institutionalized party with much universal welfare programs. Thus, the last hypothesis:

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:third}] \label{hyp:third}
	The working class's influence on universal welfare is greater when party institutionalization increases.
\end{hyp}

\section{Data and Empirical Specification}
\subsection{Sample Selection}
\subsubsection{Authoritarian Regimes}

\begin{figure}[!htbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{"../3. Datasets_Codebooks/Figures/Plot1"}
	\caption{The distribution of democracies and autocracies}
	\label{fig:plot1}
\end{figure}

I utilize the lexical indices of the Skaaning's in the V-dem data set (\textit{e\_lexical\_index}) to classify regime types. The variable is a combined index of six binary indicators. Thus, only the scale of 6 shows universal suffrage with a competitive, party-free, fair election country. Since it covers from 1800-2017, I expect these criteria help to obtain sufficient size of the sample. Figure \ref{fig:plot1} shows that this binary classification of political regimes provides a relatively clear distinction between the two categories along with alternative continuous regime variable, electoral democracy index of V-dem. I compare the classification with the arbitrary cut-point (0.5) of electoral democracy index of V-Dem, which many studies of comparative politics are taking. The results show that only 3.64\% of the authoritarian regimes has the value greater than 0.5 of electoral democracy index. It means the criteria I use to distinguish authoritarian regimes from democracies is relevant for this study.\\\par



\subsubsection{Temporal Coverage}

Since autocrats do not rule with coercion alone, they need support. \citet{Cassani2017a} argues that autocrats attempt to invest considerable efforts and resources to buy `popular' supports. It is necessary to understand the targets that autocrats want to co-opt. The popular supports, unlike democracies, can imply a different population of society because the autocrats would only want to obtain minimally necessary supports. For the autocrats, it is inefficient to consume resources to obtain unnecessary support. Then, how and when are the different classes organized and effective for autocrats? 

\begin{figure}[!htbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{"../3. Datasets_Codebooks/Figures/Plot3"}
	\caption{The numbers of class coalitions across the time}
	\label{fig:plot2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plot2} shows how the numbers of class coalitions in authoritarian regimes vary over time. As mentioned above, the urban working class before the year of 1917, the Russian Revolution, is not politically significant and effective groups for ruling the regimes.\footnote{Before the Russian Revolution (1917), the cases of the working class as important groups for the regime are Bolivia (1848-1857, 1871).} Previous literature also stresses the temporal dynamics of classes on the welfare state. \citet{Rasmussen2018} show that the working class mobilized their political power through unions in the late nineteenth century. Utilizing the cases of Ghent systems of unemployment insurance, they assert that the historical records of Western European states suggests that timing matters: the level of power resource institutionalization varies by periods \citep[821-822]{Rasmussen2018}. Because I expect the working class would build a coalition to foster welfare programs, it is reasonable to restrict the sample after the Russian Revolution, which is an event showing working classes matter. 


\subsection{Welfare Programs}

A vital contribution of the analysis I develop is to clarify why authoritarian regimes design social policies to promote the welfare of citizens. I begin with exploring welfare programs in terms of the \textit{Universalism}. The theoretical concept of the universalism of welfare can be traced back to \citet{Titmuss1974}. He approaches welfare programs qualitatively and normatively. He argues that social policy should be analyzed by its necessity, culture, tradition, and history. Universalism states society should carry the crucial responsibility of the failure of the individual citizens, and it is regarded as a sort of altruism with which everyone can be beneficiary of such needs. In this analysis, following \citet{Knutsen2018} and \citet{Rasmussen2019}, I measure universalism of authoritarian welfare state using alternative measurements to test the extended theoretical arguments.

I utilize the Social Policy around the World (SPaW) Database, which is developed by \citet{Rasmussen2016}. The \textit{Universal Index} as formal rules in an authoritarian regime, meaning the extent to which groups in society would be included in the welfare programs and the extent to the degree to which all citizens are eligible for a benefit independent of their labor market status. The \textit{Universal Index,} of SPaW, asks ``the degree to which all citizens are eligible for a benefit independent of their labor market status.'' It is expected to capture which parts of the population are included on equal terms in the same program. For example, contribution-based or employment-based programs covering one major group are scored 2. Scores of 3 indicate that programs are contribution-based or employment-based and cover two major groups, and so on, up to 8- scores where seven groups are covered. Maximum 9-scores indicate all residents are automatically entitled to benefits, a fully universal system \citep{Rasmussen2016,Rasmussen2019}. Thus, the U.I. of SPaW shows the extent of universal coverage in welfare programs.

%Secondly, I also use an alternative variable to measure the level of welfare universalism from the V-dem data set. The U.I. of V-dem relies on expert coding that asks ``how many welfare programs are means-tested and how many benefits all (or virtually all) members of the polity.'' The value of 0 means there are no, or extremely limited, welfare state policies. The maximum value of 5 states that almost all welfare state policies are universal. It is measured as ordinal and converted to the interval. Although this \textit{Universal Programs} cannot tell the variations of different welfare programs, it is relatively advantageous to test the first hypothesis (H\ref{hyp:first}) compared to other measurements such as a total sum of social expenditure. The U.I. of V-dem shows the compositions of welfare programs  that a state has.

%The dataset covers 154 countries from 1790 to 2013. \citep{Rasmussen2016}. I would utilize the \textit{Encompassingness} and \textit{Universalism} indices as both aggregated form and separate form by programs. I expect this would show the relative levels of welfare \textit{Encompassingness} and \textit{Universalism} across authoritarian regime-year units.\par

\subsection{Class coalition}

This paper focuses on the different influences of class coalitions on welfare programs since classes are expected to make social pressure on decision-makers based on their distinctive interests. It is assumed that individuals who belong to similar socioeconomic strata are more likely to have converging preferences over social policies \citep[1495]{Dahlum2019}, capturing which class is the critical supporters for autocrats to maintain in power. Following the previous relevant literature, I identify the classes that are expected to affect the levels of the authoritarian welfare state into four: \textit{Urban Working classes, Urban middle classes, Party elites, and the Military}.

I use the variable measuring regime's most important support group (\textit{v3regimpgroup}) of the V-dem data set. The variable is measured by asking, ``which (one) group does the current political regime rely on most strongly in order to maintain power.'' It contains categories of which, if it were to retract its support to the regime, would most endanger the regime. Although \textit{Class coalition} shows various classes that matter for the political survival of regimes, I manipulate the variables \textit{v3regimpgroup} according to theoretical expectations. 

Additionally, I define other three groups as \textit{party elites} of the party or parties that control the executive, \textit{the military}, and \textit{the urban middle classes}. As I expect the interests between the urban classes and rural middle classes would be different \citep{Dahlum2019}, the rural middle classes are excluded.
% Appendix reports the descriptive characteristics of residual classes that are not used in the primary analysis.

	\caption{The Distribution of Universalism index by Class Coalitions in Autocracies}
	\label{fig:plot3}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plot3} is the distribution of universalism index of the SPaW dataset by class coalitions. The universalism index measures how many social groups each welfare program (old-age pension, mater, sick, unemployment, working accident, family) covers. The urban middle class shows the highest mean value of \textit{Universal Index}. Urban working classes, Party elites, and the military follow. It shows the welfare programs of authoritarian regimes building coalition with the urban class provide universal welfare programs covering broader groups of societies than authoritarian regimes with other class coalitions. Figure \ref{fig:plot3} is the density plot of the relationship between universal index and class coalitions in the sample. Although country fixed effects model is the most appropriate for the analysis, even this density plot results suggest that there can be a possible association between class coalitions and universal welfare programs as I expect.


\subsection{Party Institutionalization}

To show how autocrats co-opt the potential class coalition in selectorate, I include \textit{party institutionalization index} (P.I.) that comes from the V-Dem data set. Political parties are the platforms to connect the elites and the masses. The P.I. is reviewed in \citet{Bizzarro2018} and \citet{Rasmussen2019}. P.I. consists of several indicators, which capture the various features\footnote{The P.I. is the upper-level measurement, which is combined with five lower-level indicators of V-dem. The P.I. is "formed by adding the indicators for party organizations (\textit{v2psorgs}), party branches (\textit{v2psprbrch}), party linkages (\textit{v2psprlnks}), distinct party platforms (\textit{v2psplats}), and legislative party cohesion (\textit{v2pscohesv}), after standardization." \citep[2]{Bizzarro2017}} of the main parties in a political system.\par

P.I. enlarges the comparability of party institutionalization for the broadest available set of countries and years from 1900 to the present from 170 countries \citep[9]{Rasmussen2019}. Therefore, this data set is more appropriate for extensive cross-sectional studies, especially for developing countries. In terms of welfare provisions, the institutionalized party can absorb the influence of class coalition on welfare programs since institutionalized parties can be used as a mean of co-optation.\par

%By theoretical argument of authoritarian co-optation, the institutionalized parties are meaningful only when it is understood in the context of the supply dimension. The elites of authoritarian regimes provide the institutionalized parties to the constituents unilaterally. When I utilize the P.I, as a combined one, it can lead to biased results since the working mechanisms behind the parties might be different between democracies and authoritarian regimes. Thus, I only take the Distinct platforms (\textit{v2psplats}) concerns how many parties among those with representation in the legislature have publicly available, and distinct, party platforms. Also, I include the Constituency linkages (\textit{v2psprlnks}), which considers the most common form of linkage between parties and their constituents across all major parties.

%I exclude the other three indicators of P.I. as it is not appropriate to explain the research question of this project. For example, the Party organization, which considers how many parties have permanent organizations is less critical as "parties existing outside the legislature are ignored because these parties are not instruments of co-optation" in authoritarian regimes \citep[1285]{Gandhi2007}.\par

\subsection{Control Variables}

Alongside the critical predictors of interest, I include several variables for which I think there is a particularly strong theoretical rationale for considering as confounders, which are economic and demographic variables traditionally used in the welfare state.  First, I control for the GDP (\textit{lnGDP}), defined as the log of Gross Domestic Product per capita (in constant U.S. dollars, base 2011) to account for Wagner’s Law. The \textit{lnGDP} is taken from the Maddison Project (\citealp{Bolt2014}; \citealp[14]{Rasmussen2019}). Secondly, I include the variables of resource dependency and the log of population (\textit{lnPop}) from \citet{Miller2015a} to control the effect of unearned income and the size of population on welfare programs.

%First, many studies account for the influence of globalization on the development of welfare state \citep{Lee1999, Burgoon2001a, Rudra2005, Yi2014}. Globalization in this article is operationalized by the level of trade integration: Here, the measure of trade openness is the sum of the total imports and exports as a share of a country’s GDP.\par

\par


%include three demographic control variables, the percentage of Elderly Population (65 years old or older), the percentage of the Youth Population (under 15 years of age) because health care, social security, and education spending are sensitive to how many people are old or young. 

%The military can be served as an alternative institution to rule. However, it is difficult to measure how much the military matters in the decision-making process in a regime. I include the size of the military to control the influence of the military on welfare programs. Also, I include resource dependence from oil, diamonds, and agriculture to control the effect of `unearned' income on welfare programs. Some argue that an authoritarian regime with a high level of revenues from natural resources may show more extensive welfare programs or less repression \citep{Ross2006, Wright2008, LaPorte2017}. The size of the military, resource dependence come from \citet{Miller2015a}. The data for all the control variables mentioned above, except for the Maddison Project and \citet{Miller2015a}, comes from The World Bank World Development Indicator. 

\subsection{Estimating strategy}

I test the hypotheses with an unbalanced, time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data that cover 95 autocracies, respectively, during the period 1917–2000. TSCS data has the advantage of being able to track the correlation of various variables simultaneously with the differences across units and the longitudinal changes of individual units. However, TSCS data with OLS regression can lead to several problems such as heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, which produce inefficient estimates.\footnote{Prior to empirical analysis, I test the possible problems of panel-level heteroscedasticity with likelihood ratio tests and of autocorrelation with Wooldridge test. The two tests suggest that both panel-level heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation issues can exist.} First, I estimate the models with panel-corrected standard errors to deal with heteroscedasticity problem. \citet{Beck1995} introduces an econometric technique that uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with the lagged dependent variable, unit, and period dummies and calculates panel-corrected standard errors. Next, I include unit dummies (here, state dummies) to control unit-specific varying factors that are difficult to observe and quantify. Also, I manipulate three-period dummies to control exogenous global events that are expected to affect welfare programs such as World War I, II, and the Cold war period.

Possible autocorrelation is another problem to solve. \citet{Beck1995} suggest to include a lagged dependent variable. However, when models take the lagged dependent variable, the models would estimate the change of the dependent variable, not the levels of the dependent variable. Since this study attempts to trace how the levels of welfare programs in terms of universality vary, I do not include the lagged dependent variable. Instead, following the suggestions of \citet{Plumper2005}, I use the Prais–Winsten transformation to deal with the autocorrelation problem, assuming the first-order autocorrelation within panels. Lastly, all explanatory variables are lagged by three years to control for the potential exogenous effects of welfare programs.

\section{Empirical Analysis}
\input{tables/Hypothesis1.tex}
Table \ref{tab:table1} shows the results of testing the research hypotheses. The control variables are statistically significant, as the previous literature expected. As population increases, the welfare is more likely to be universal because the total numbers it should cover increases. Also, as the GDP per capita increases, it is more likely to enhance universal welfare programs. When the welfare programs allocate the resources from the limited total sum of the regime's revenue, the increase of GDP per capita is the increase of the total sum of revenue, which means the portion of revenue for welfare programs becomes extensive. Lastly, the resource dependency shows the influence of unearned resources on welfare programs. An authoritarian regime can reduce the risk of ouster when it has more unearned income \citep{Wright2013}, which makes coopation with private goods less costly than with public goods \citep{BuenodeMesquita2003}. Autocrats tend to avoid providing public goods as much as possible since they should establish credible commitment that is difficult to withdraw in the future. Thus, as the resource dependency increases, an authoritarian regime is less likely to provide universal welfare programs.

Besides the control variables, Model 1 shows that all class coalitions make authoritarian provides welfare programs, which cover more social groups of regimes compared to authoritarian regimes with the urban middle class coalitions. The urban working class coalition is more likely to provide universal welfare programs to cover broader range of social groups than the urban middle class does. Also, party elites and the military also show that they are more likely to provide broader welfare coverage than the urban middle class. It is different results of the existing studies that emphasize the role and leverage of the urban middle class in terms of welfare provisions.

Model 2 tests the second hypothesis of party institutionalization, which does not have statistical significance. \citet[16]{Rasmussen2019} indicate that party institutionalization can foster universal welfare programs. However, when I test with authoritarian regimes, it is difficult to argue that institutionalized party increases universal welfare programs. Model 3 tests the competing two hypotheses of Model 1 and Model 2. When I control the party institutionalization, the military has no statistical significance, which implies they are not distinctive from the urban middle class. Otherwise, urban working class and party elites are still significant that they show broader universal coverage of welfare programs than the urban middle class.





The different findings of Table \ref{tab:table1} confirm both research hypotheses for universal welfare coverage. When autocrats make coalitions with the working class, they provide welfare programs targeting broader social groups than the urban middle class coalitions. The institutionalized party, which is considered as an essential mechanism for resource distribution in existing studies, does not affect the relationship between class coalitions and the coverage of universal welfare programs (Model 3). However, there is a possibility that authoritarian regimes use institutionalized party as a tool of efficient resource distribution when they confront extensive social pressures from urban working classes (Hypothesis \ref{hyp:third}).% , institutionalized party shows distinctive features to explain the delivery of welfare programs, which imply 


% Unlike previous literature on institutionalized party, not all aspects of the party enhance universal welfare programs. When the parties have more permanent local branches or have more cohesive memberships, authoritarian regimes are more likely to have welfare programs that benefit everyone.

%	\caption{Disaggregated Party Institutionalization and Welfare Universalism (95\% C.I.)}
%	\label{fig:plot4}
%\end{figure}

To understand the dynamics between the effects of urban working class coalitions and institutionalized parties in authoritarian regime, I estimate the interaction between urban working class coalition and party institutionalization. Figure \ref{fig:plot5} indicates the effect of urban working class coalitions are mediated by the levels of party institutionalization. As parties are more institutionalized, an authoritarian regime which builds coalition with urban working class provides universal welfare when it has more institutionalized parties. Thus, as the hypothesis \ref{hyp:third}, Figure \ref{fig:plot5} shows the influence of urban working class on universal welfare program is greater when party institutionalization increases.

	\label{fig:plot5}
\end{figure}

%\input{tables/Hypothesis1_pi2_long.tex}

%The second hypothesis states that the working class's influence on cash-benefit welfare programs (e.g., old-age pensions, sickness, and unemployment) is the least compared to other classes. This hypothesis is built on the previous welfare-state literature expecting the working class is sensitive to the labor environment. Existing studies argue that the working class does not only support universal welfare programs, but also prefer long-lasting benefits which can improve their conditions. Thus, I test the second hypothesis with six-disaggregated welfare programs (\textit{old-age pension, mater, sickness, working incidences, unemployment, family}) as dependent variables. If autocrats prefer to provide private goods when they expect smaller winning coalition and try to provide public goods vice versa, 

%According to the hypothesis, the working class has greater influence 

%\input{tables/Hypothesis2.tex}

%By theoretical argument of authoritarian co-optation, the institutionalized parties are meaningful only when it is understood in the context of the supply dimension. The elites of authoritarian regimes provide the institutionalized parties to the constituents unilaterally. When I utilize the P.I, as a combined one, it can lead to biased results since the working mechanisms behind the parties might be different between democracies and authoritarian regimes. Thus, I only take the Distinct platforms (\textit{v2psplats}) concerns how many parties among those with representation in the legislature have publicly available, and distinct, party platforms. Also, I include the Constituency linkages (\textit{v2psprlnks}), which considers the most common form of linkage between parties and their constituents across all major parties.

%Table \ref{tab:table2} takes similar model specification with different dependent variables, disaggregated welfare programs. According to the theoretical framework of this project, a class coalition affects the paths of welfare delivery. Unlike previous research such as \citet{Rasmussen2019}, party institutionalization may not fully explain the variations of welfare programs. An institutionalized party may also be one of the outcomes, which is produced by a coalition among different classes in a society. If so, the institutionalized parties would be associated with different welfare programs in divergent ways.\par

\section{Conclusion}

This study argues that how universal welfare programs depend on the groups with which autocrats want to make a coalition. The first hypothesis states that the urban working class drives welfare programs compared to the urban middle class considered as a prominent class affecting the size of welfare states. Table \ref{tab:table1} shows that the first hypothesis is confirmed. The relationship between class coalitions without the military and universal welfare programs holds even when I control the party institutionalization. Autocrats consider whom to co-opt because it helps them to stay in office if autocrats successfully embrace the essential class. Although recent works have focused on the role of institutionalized political parties, class coalitions matter when each class recognizes its distinctive interests and has incentives to achieve them. If so, the class, which autocrats should co-opt, can affect the autocrats' decision-making of resource allocation. The urban working class, which is relatively poor and large in society, would require autocrats to provide universal welfare programs to foster its condition (Model 1, Model 3). 

The institutionalized parties do not solely influence on the universal welfare programs (Model 2). However, Figure \ref{fig:plot5} shows that autocrats can mitigate the threats from classes through specific institutions---\textit{institutionalized parties}. Some studies explore the influence of authoritarian legislatures \citep{Jensen2014, Truex2012} and suggest that autocrats may establish such institutions for controlling and managing potential or possible oppositions in the elites through the institutional way. According to \citet{Magaloni2006}, however, institutionalized parties are also utilized for similar purposes. In authoritarian regimes, political parties are not only the machine to mobilize the support of the masses. Political parties can control the flow of information and identify potential rivals. Hence, when political parties are the platforms that are more closely related to the masses than the legislature in authoritarian regimes, the institutional functions of parties can be applied to the masses. Thus, the influence of the urban working class, relative to the urban middle class, may depend on party strength.

Also, Model 2 implies the possibility that the functions of the institutionalized party can be different under authoritarian regimes from democracies. Although some of the studies show that the institutionalized party is more likely to enhance universal welfare programs \citep{Rasmussen2019}, the results of Model 2 in this paper requires to rethink whether we can expect the role and leverage of institutionalized party to be homogeneous across the regimes. Institutionalized parties can lead states to establish extensive welfare states, but they are not necessary.

%Figure \ref{fig:plot4} shows that not all aspects of institutionalized parties contribute to improving universal welfare programs. They do if they have permanent local branches and have cohesive memberships. It implies that autocrats can reshape the relationship between the supporters and themselves using institution---parties. \citet{Rasmussen2019} presume that institutionalized parties will lead states to establish extensive welfare states, but it is not necessary.

This study has several limitations in terms of measurements and unobservable factors of authoritarian regimes. However, most of the studies on authoritarian regimes face the issue of data availability. Under the limitations, this preliminary analysis provides several implications. First, it requires us to revisit what constraints the choices of autocrats, and how autocrats try to overcome it. Second, it should be cautious that setting a single continuum to evaluate both democracy and authoritarian regimes can overlook significant variations within it.
