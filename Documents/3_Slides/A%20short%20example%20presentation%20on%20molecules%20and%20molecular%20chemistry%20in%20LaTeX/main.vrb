\frametitle{Experiments with water and rings}

To see how the \texttt{chemfig} package creates the drawings from your code, let us look at the simple water molecule:

\vskip 0.3cm
\begin{center}
\chemfig{H_2O} is created with \verb|\chemfig{H_2O}|
\end{center}

The simple \LaTeX{} code on the right is automatically converted into the molecular formula for water on the left.

Rings are similarly easy to code - consider the examples below:

\vskip 0.3cm

\chemfig[atom style={scale=0.5}]{A*5(-B-C-D-E-)} =
\verb|\chemfig{A*5(-B-C-D-E-)}|

\vskip 0.3cm

\chemfig[atom style={scale=0.5}]{*6(=-=-=-)} = \verb|\chemfig{*6(=-=-=-)}|
